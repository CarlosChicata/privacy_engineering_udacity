# Atlantis privacy-protected voting app
## Purpose:

Give voting app for the atlantis election with privacy features.

## Requirements overview

Your project will require you to consider things such as:
* To alleviate the public concern, the founding delegation of the Republic of Atlantis has nominated you, an expert in privacy engineering, to build out a reliable, and privacy-protective voting system. To do this, you'll have to consider things such as:
* Enforce Ballot Secrecy - there should be no record of how a person voted, only whether they voted or not.
* Protect voter data within our voting registry
* Voter specific balloting - any ballot that is issued must be issued to a particular voter, and the software should require that that voter be the person who casts that ballot
* Communicate Privacy Features to the User
* Detect and Stop Double Voting
* Allow issuing of multiple ballots to a single voter - Voters may receive multiple ballots, but you must enforce in software that only one of their ballots will be counted.
*  And finally, ensure the correct election result.
